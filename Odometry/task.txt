Odometry
In a mobile robot, implement your proposed communication protocol based on a serial interface that allows for the command to 

    1. drive straight for a specified distance forward and backward.

    2. Turn right or left by a specified angle (with an accuracy of at least 45 degrees).

The implementation of determining the robot's position should be based on encoders on the robot's drive motors, and control should be carried out in a feedback loop to increase the accuracy of the actions performed.

The final test will be the robot's execution of the following task:

The operator manually controls the robot to travel from designated point A to point B.

Then the robot is moved back to point A. Through the serial interface, a sequence of commands is sent to it, enabling the robot to autonomously travel from point A to point B.
